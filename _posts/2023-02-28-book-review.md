["Weapons of Math Destruction"](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241363/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/) by Cathy O'Neil is an eye-opening book that reveals how algorithms, which are designed to be unbiased, can actually be discriminatory towards certain groups of people. O'Neil provides several examples of "weapons of math destruction" in our society, including predictive policing, teacher evaluations, and credit scoring.


With AI's recent spike in popularity, I really appreciated reading Cathy O'Neil powerful critique of the growing use of AI and algorithmic decision-making in our society. O'Neil provides an important warning that algorithms aren't magical and all-knowing, but that many of these models come with potential downsides or biases. All in all, I thought that O'Neil made a compelling case for the need to carefully consider the ethical implications of AI and to ensure that it is developed and deployed in ways that are fair, transparent, and accountable.

Though I loved her examples and explanations throughout the book, I wish that O'Neil would have given more potential solutions to the problems that she identified. While she does provide some suggestions for how to address the issues raised in the book, they felt a little vague and not as detailed as they could be. AI is only going to become more relevant in our lives and I wish that by the end of the book I felt a greater optimism on how models can be improved to help give answers without discrimination. 

I think that the points hit by Cathy O'Neil in her book are very important for our increasingly data-driven world. ["Weapons of Math Destruction"](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418831/ref=asc_df_0553418831/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312681615521&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1949352830966027308&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9029857&hvtargid=pla-415790116013&psc=1) is a thought-provoking book that would be well-suited for anyone who is interested in the intersection of technology and society. It is particularly relevant for those who are concerned about the potential for bias and discrimination in algorithms, and the ways in which they can engender inequality. O'Neil's clear writing style and use of real-world examples make the book accessible to a wide range of readers, and it has already sparked important conversations about the role of algorithms in society.
